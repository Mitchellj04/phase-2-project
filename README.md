# Introduction 

Welcome to my Adventure blog!

## Getting Started 

To be able to start the web page. 

Go to the terminal and locate the folder in which the project is saved. 

Once there make sure you have npm installed and type in the code 'npm start'

This will start a new local host to run the server in your browser. 

## Gathering the Data

To be able to fetch the data from the json server you will also need to run the data on a local host. 

First you need to locate the folder within the project folder that contains the data. 

Next you have to type in the termianl 'json-server --watch --port (desired port, example: 4000) Postdata.json

This will open a server for the json file to be fetch to be displayed on the webpage.

### How it works 

-On the home page you have a collection of blog posts that you can scroll through. 

-At the top of the page is the navagation menu. The navagation menu consists of clickable links to redirect you to another page. As well as an instagram icon which will redirect you to my instagram page. 

-On the right side of the page is the search bar. In the search field if you would like to search for the title of a blog you type in the title and then click on the search button to the left of the input field to display results. 

-The links in the navagation menu will redirect you to other pages such as 
    -About 
        -The About page will give a little more indepth look into my background. Such as the places I have traveled to and also has links to some of the posts based on categories
    -Create 
        -This is where you will be able to create a new blog to be added to the main home page. 
    -Contact 
        -The contact page gives information about how to contact me. This is if anyone would like to have their post featured on the page or would like to send me pictures from their trips. 

-The create page is the most essential out of the three of these. The create page allows you to create a new blog post. You are able to add an image with the icon on the left. Then type in a title for the post. As well as add a description to the post. 

-To be able to see your new post all you have to do is click the home link at the top to be redirected to the main home page. 

### Purpose 

I have been traveling around the US and parts of the world since I was young. I started my own instagram page when I was in Australia to document some of my trip. On of my passions is taking pictures and exploring new places. So what better way to do so then to create my own blog to document my journey for others to see.
